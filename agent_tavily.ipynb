Healthcare’s traditional AI tools rely on technologies developed more than 25 years ago. A narrow AI model trained on 10,000 mammograms (half from patients with confirmed cancer and half without) can detect far more differences than the human eye, resulting in 10-20% greater diagnostic accuracy than doctors. But rather than waiting for technology companies to introduce GenAI tools, physicians working alone or in conjunction with educational companies have the opportunity to drive the process and improve our nation’s health.\n",

Its capabilities continue to double annually, and [OpenAI’s GPT-5 model](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msn.com%2Fen-in%2Fmoney%2Fnews%2Fopenai-to-launch-chatgpt-5-next-week-and-here-is-everything-we-know-about-it%2Far-AA1JzzQQ%3F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cfce4f95eee944318636908ddd3877e9a%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638899301086719083%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Uwhhdi3mY6EdGq1SvE%2Fn0XCQ4Kx27HqgESfH%2F7HjXQg%3D&reserved=0) is expected to launch within days. That raises a pressing question: How will generative AI be monetized in healthcare?\n",
            "\n",
            "When OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, few in the medical community [took notice](https://www.statnews.com/2023/02/01/promises-pitfalls-chatgpt-assisted-medicine/). Most doctors saw it as a novelty, perhaps useful for administrative tasks or as a basic reference tool, but too unreliable for clinical care.\n",
            "\n",
            "In just a few years, that perception has shifted. Today’s genAI tools from companies like Google, Microsoft and Nvidia [outperform most physicians](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/04/230428130734.htm?) on national medical exams and clinical challenges. Although none are currently recommended for patient use without physician oversight, that restriction is likely to be lifted soon.\n",

            "\n",
            "Healthcare’s traditional AI tools rely on technologies developed more than 25 years ago. Known as narrow AI, these models are trained on large datasets to solve specific, well-defined problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "These applications are developed by training AI models to compare two datasets, detect dozens of subtle differences between them and assign a probability factor to each. For reliable results, the training data must be objective, accurate and replicable. That’s why nearly all narrow AI tools are applied in visual specialties like radiology, pathology and ophthalmology — not cognitive fields that depend on subjective entries in the electronic medical record. Although these tools outperform clinicians, they are “narrow” and can be used only for the specific task they were designed to complete.\n",
            "\n",
            "Take mammography, for example. Early-stage breast cancer can mimic benign conditions such as fibrocystic disease, causing radiologists to disagree when interpreting the same image. A narrow AI model trained on 10,000 mammograms (half from patients with confirmed cancer and half without) can detect far more differences than the human eye, resulting in [10-20% greater diagnostic accuracy](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/health/ai-breast-cancer-detection/) than doctors.\n",

            "To evaluate narrow AI tools, the FDA assesses both the accuracy of the training data and the consistency of the tool’s performance, similar to how it approves new drugs. This approach, however, doesn’t work for generative AI. The development process and resulting technology are fundamentally different.\n",
            "\n",
            "## The New Opportunity: Generative AI\n",
            "\n",
            "Today’s large language models like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini are trained on the near-totality of internet-accessible content, including thousands of medical textbooks and academic journals.\n",
            "\n",
            "This broad, in-depth training enables LLMs to respond to virtually any medical question. But unlike narrow AI, their answers are highly dependent on how users frame their questions, prompt the model and follow up for clarification. That user dependency makes traditional FDA validation, which relies on consistent and repeatable responses, effectively impossible.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the multimodal nature of generative AI (working across writing, audio, images and video) opens a wide range of opportunities for clinicians.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, I recently spoke with a surgeon who used ChatGPT to interpret a post-operative chest X-ray. The AI not only provided an accurate assessment, but it did so immediately, a full 12 hours before the radiologist issued a formal report. Had there been a serious problem that the surgeon failed to recognize, the LLM would have proven lifesaving. Even without formal approval, physicians and patients increasingly consult generative AI for medical expertise.\n",
            "\n",
            "While there’s still debate over whether LLMs are ready for independent clinical use by patients, the pace of progress is breathtaking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Microsoft recently reported that its Diagnostic Orchestrator tool achieved [85.5% accuracy](https://www.fastcompany.com/91361467/microsoft-says-ai-can-diagnose-tough-medical-cases-better-than-physicians) across 304 *New England Journal of Medicine* case studies, compared to only 20% for physicians.\n",
            "\n",
            "## How Will Generative AI Be Monetized In Medicine?\n",
            "\n",
            "As generative AI becomes more powerful each year, two distinct approaches are emerging for how it might be monetized in healthcare.\n",
            "\n",
            "Each model has trade-offs:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Entrepreneurial Tech Model\n",
            "\n",
            "Medical care often fails to deliver optimal outcomes at a price patients can afford. This monetization model would seek to close those gaps.\n",
            "\n",
            "Take diabetes, where fewer than half of patients achieve adequate disease control. The result: hundreds of thousands of preventable and costly heart attacks, kidney failure and limb amputations each year. In other cases, patients struggle to access timely, affordable advice for new symptoms or for managing their multiple chronic conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "One way to solve these problems would be through genAI tools built by entrepreneurial companies. Venture funding would allow startups to apply a process called *distillation* to extract domain-specific knowledge from open-source foundation models like DeepSeek or Meta’s Llama.\n",
            "\n",
            "They would then refine these models, training them on radiologist interpretations of thousands of X-rays, transcripts from patient advice centers or anonymized recordings of conversations with patients. The result: specialized generative AI tools designed to address specific gaps in care delivery.\n",
            "\n",
            "Developing these tools will be expensive, both in terms of model training and the FDA approval process. Companies would also face legal liability for adverse outcomes. Still, if successful, these tools would likely command high prices and deliver substantial profits.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Clinician-Led GenAI Education\n",
            "\n",
            "Although less profitable than an FDA-approved device or bot, the second path to genAI monetization would prove easier to develop, much less expensive and far more transformative.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rather than developing new software, this approach empowers patients to use existing large language models (ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude) to access similar expertise. In this model, clinicians, educators or national specialty societies — not private companies — would take the lead and share in the benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "They would create low-cost instructional materials for various patient-learning preferences ranging from digital guides and printed pamphlets to YouTube videos and short training courses. These resources would teach patients how to use any of the publicly available large language models safely and effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using these educational tools, patients would learn how to enter blood glucose readings from home monitors or blood pressure measurements from electronic cuffs. The large language models would then assess their clinical progress and suggest whether medication adjustments might be needed. Patients could also ask questions about new symptoms, receive likely diagnoses and learn when to seek immediate medical care.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conjunction with their physicians, they could use genAI’s image and video capabilities to identify signs of wound infections and alert their surgeons. Those individuals with chronic heart failure could monitor their conditions more closely and catch signs of decompensation early — allowing cardiologists to intervene before hospitalization becomes necessary. A GI specialist could identify complex intestinal conditions using daily patient-reported inputs, or a neurologist could diagnose ALS by analyzing videos of a patient’s gait.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike startup models that require tens of millions in funding and FDA approval, these educational tools could be developed and deployed quickly by doctors and other clinicians. Because they teach patients how to use existing tools rather than offer direct medical advice, they would avoid many regulatory burdens and face reduced legal liability. And with 40% of physicians already working part-time or in gig roles, there are hundreds, or likely thousands, of experts ready to contribute.\n",
            "\n",
            "And since generative AI tools can provide information in dozens of languages and literacy levels, they would offer unprecedented accessibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Which Path Will We Take?\n",
            "\n",
            "The two models aren’t mutually exclusive, and both will likely shape the future of medicine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the potential for massive financial return from the first approach, we can assume that dozens of entrepreneurs are already developing disease-focused generative AI tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "But rather than waiting for technology companies to introduce genAI tools, physicians working alone or in conjunction with educational companies have the opportunity to drive the process and improve our nation’s health.\n",

            "A [recent study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09089) challenges the widespread belief that AI tools accelerate software development. Researchers at [METR](https://metr.org/) conducted a randomized controlled trial of experienced open-source developers using AI-enhanced development tools like Claude 3.5 and Cursor Pro. Contrary to expectations, they found that AI-assisted programming led to a 19% increase in task completion time—even as developers believed they were working faster. The findings reveal a potential gap between AI’s perceived promise and its real-world impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "To evaluate AI’s influence under realistic conditions, the researchers designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) rooted in production-grade environments. Rather than using synthetic benchmarks, they recruited experienced contributors to complete real tasks across mature open-source repositories.\n",
            "\n",
            "Participants were 16 professional developers with an average of five years of experience on the projects they were assigned. The repositories included realistic, 'in-anger' issues drawn from their own codebases:very large (> 1.1m lines of code), well established open source projects.\n",
            "\n",
            "Across 246 tasks, each developer was randomly assigned to a maximum of two-hour sessions either with or without access to AI assistance. Those with access used Cursor Pro, a code editor with integrated support for Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. The control group was explicitly blocked from using AI tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "The study collected both objective and subjective metrics, including task duration, code quality, and developer perception. Before and after each task, developers and external experts predicted the likely effect of AI on productivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The central result was both striking and unexpected: AI-assisted developers took 19% longer to complete tasks than those without AI. This contradicted pre-task expectations from both participants and experts, who had predicted an average speedup of ~40%.\n",

These frictions likely offset any up-front gains from code generation, revealing a significant disconnect between perceived and actual productivity.\n",

The contrast between perception and outcome underscores the study’s importance of grounding AI tool evaluation not just in user sentiment, but in rigorous measurement.\n",
            "\n",
            "The authors caution against overgeneralizing their findings. While the study shows a measurable slowdown with AI tooling in this particular setting, they stress that many of the contributing factors are specific to their design. The developers were working in large, mature open-source codebases—projects with strict review standards and unfamiliar internal logic. The tasks were constrained to two-hour blocks, limiting exploration, and all AI interactions were funneled through a single toolchain\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly, the authors emphasize that future systems may overcome the challenges observed here. Improvements in prompting techniques, agent scaffolding, or domain-specific fine tuning could unlock real productivity gains even in the settings tested.\n",
            "\n",
            "As AI capabilities continue to progress rapidly, the authors frame their findings not as a verdict on the usefulness of AI tools—but as a data point in a fast-evolving landscape that still requires rigorous, real-world evaluation.\n",
